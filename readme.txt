All the functions and .c files are implemented according to the Project 1 description.
Below are the points to note about the code:
1. Shell script execute works but not with the C code in computer.c instead with the .cpp code with the same logic implemented on both code files.
2. The code runs automatically once you enter the name of file and base and displays the values of registers and memory.
3. The code computes all the CPU registers values correct hence the objective of the project is achieved.
4. To compile the code just type ./computer.exe
